Hello everyone!

I'm new to GitHub, and I'm excited to share my first project, which I've developed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although I'm not entirely confident yet, I'm happy with how it has turned out as my first working project.
I would greatly appreciate your feedback on any bugs you find, as well as suggestions for features that could be improved or added. Thank you for your time and support!
